AS3-Utils
=========

A set of helpers for AS3 graphics, layout, and array/string manipulation. 

This library has basic tools for building an AS3 app. It includes functions to:

* manage sprites (safely add/remove/restack)
* create graphics (rectangles, circles, triangles)
* add drop shadows and filters
* lay out displayobjects in columns, rows, or relative to each other
* manipulate arrays, objects, and strings
* manipulate colors
* manipulate dates
* queue events to handle long processes asynchronously
* communicate with http resources
* a bunch of other stuff you may or may not need.
