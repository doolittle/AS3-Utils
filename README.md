AS3-Utils
=========

A set of helpers for AS3 graphics, layout, and array/string manipulation. 

This library has basic tools for building an AS3 app. It includes functions to:

* manage sprites (safely add/remove/restack)
* create graphics (rectangles, circles, triangles)
* add drop shadows and filters
* lay out displayobjects in columns, rows, or relative to each other
* manipulate arrays, objects, and strings
* manipulate colors
* manipulate dates
* queue events to handle long processes asynchronously
* communicate with http resources
* a bunch of other stuff you may or may not need.

This library was build to support miscellaneous Flash apps and probably has a lot of overlap with [as3/AS3-utils](https://github.com/as3/AS3-Utils). 

This library is used by the open-source book [Between Page and Screen](https://github.com/doolittle/BetweenPageAndScreen) - a popup book of poetry that uses augmented reality. See a demo at [betweenpageandscreen.com](http://betweenpageandscreen.com)
